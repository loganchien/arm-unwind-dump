ARM Unwind Opcode Dump
======================

This is a command line tool to dump the ARM unwind opcodes for stack unwinding
during the zero-cost exception handling.  This tool can read the ARM object
file, and print the unwind instructions in YAML format.

Installation
------------

First, you have to make sure that you have a latest LLVM installation, and
make sure that `llvm-config` command is in your `$PATH`.

Second, please run `make` to build the command:

    $ make

Now, you can run `arm-unwind-dump` to disassemble every ARM object file.
